# web3-lab
Smart contract experiments and Web3 practice projects using Foundry & Solidity.

# Foundry Lab

This repository is a curated collection of my smart contract learning journey, built using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), Solidity, and modern Web3 tools.

It includes:

- 🧱 Basic contract examples
- ✅ Unit tests using `forge test`
- 🚀 Scripts for deployment and interaction
- 🧪 Experimentation with different smart contract patterns and gas optimizations

## 🔧 Tools & Tech

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) – Fast, modular Ethereum development toolkit
- Solidity (v0.8.x)
- VS Code
- GitHub Copilot (sometimes 😉)
